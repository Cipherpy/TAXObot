Rizzo, A.E., Steiner, T.M. & Amaral, A.C.Z. Glyceridae Grube 1850 (Annelida: Polychaeta) from Southern and Southeastern Brazil, including a new species of Glycera. Biota Neotrop. Sep/Dez 2007 vol. 7, no. 3 http:// www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v7n3/pt/abstract?article+bn00407032007. ISSN 1676-0603.
This systematic study of the polychaete species of the family Glyceridae is part of a broader program to inventory and determine parameters for conservation and sustainable use of the marine biodiversity off the southeastern and southern coast of Brazil. The material studied was collected from intertidal sandy beaches, the inner continental shelf (<50 m depth) off the northern coast of the state of São Paulo, and the outer continental shelf and part of the continental slope (depths from 60 to 808 m) off the state of Rio de Janeiro south to Rio Grande do Sul (22° S - 34° 40’ S). The descriptions of several species were improved, adding new and important taxonomic characters, mainly related to proboscideal papillae. A key for identification of the glycerid species from southeastern and southern Brazil is also provided. Eight species of Glyceridae were identified: Glycera americana Leidy 1855; Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870; Glycera dibranchiata Ehlers 1868; Glycera lapidum Quatrefages 1866; Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887; Glycera tesselata Grube 1863; Hemipodia californiensis (Hartman 1938); Hemipodia simplex (Grube 1857); and a previously unknown species of Glycera.


Keywords: Glyceridae, Glycera, Hemipodia, new species, new occurrence, Brazil.


Introduction

The family Glyceridae comprises several species included in a few genera, the largest of which is Glycera Savigny 1818, fol- lowed by Hemipodia Kinberg 1865 and Glycerella Arwidsson
1899. Böggemann (2002) revalidated the genus Hemipodia as the senior synonym of Hemipodus Quatrefages 1866. The differences among the three genera are basic: Hemipodia contains species with only uniramous parapodia throughout the body, whereas in Glycera and Glycerella the parapodia are almost all biramous. The ailerons are either rod-like (Glycerella and Hemipodia) or possess a more complicated structure with outer and inner rami, and sometimes an interramal plate (Glycera). Glycera and Hemipodia have spinigerous compound neurochaetae, but in Glycerella additional falcigerous chaetae are present. Böggemann (2002) presented the first revision of all members of Glyceridae previously described worldwide, reduc- ing the total of the 166 recent taxa to only 42 species (36 Glycera,
1 Glycerella and 5 Hemipodia).
Taxonomic studies of several species of Glycera and Hemipodia (=Hemipodus) from the Brazilian coast have been carried out by Nonato & Luna (1970), Orensanz & Gianuca (1974), Rullier & Amoureux (1979), Nonato (1981), and Lana (1984). In addition, Amaral & Nonato (1996) published keys for identification of families and genera of polychaetes from Brazil and Amaral et al. (2006a) a catalogue of polychaete species from Brazil. Until now, 17 species and all three genera are mentioned for the Brazilian coast, but some of them were synonymized by Böggemann (2002).
The aim of this study is to describe and illustrate species of Glyceridae that were collected during projects to develop essential information for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity off the Brazilian coast. Eight species of glycerids were identified: Glycera americana Leidy 1855; Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870; Glycera dibranchiata Ehlers 1868; Glycera lapidum Quatrefages
1866; Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887; Glycera tesselata Grube
1863; Hemipodia californiensis (Hartman 1938) and Hemipodia simplex (Grube 1857). A new species, Glycera boeggemanni, is described and keys for identification of the species of Glycera and Hemipodia from this region are supplied.

Material and Methods

The examined material are from different programs, sampled in southern and southeastern Brazil (22° S – 34°40’ S): “Fauna de Praia” (Sandy Beach Fauna), in the intertidal zone of 13 beaches along the São Sebastião Channel (State of São Paulo); “REVIZEE/ Score Sul Bentos” (Program of Available of the Sustainable Potential of the Living Resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone - EEZ), in depths from 60 to 808 m, between Ilha Grande bay (Rio de Janeiro State) and Tramandaí city (Rio Grande do Sul State); and “BIOTA/ FAPESP - Bentos Marinho” (Benthic Marine Biodiversity in the State of São Paulo), in intertidal sandy beaches and rocky shores and non-consolidated sublittoral (50 m depth), in the northern São Paulo State. The specific methodology to each program can be found, respectively, in Amaral et al. (2003), Amaral et al. (2004) and Amaral et al. (2006b).
The nomenclature used for taxonomic features is based on Bögge- mann (2002). Semipermanent slides were mounted with a substance containing glycerin as the main component. Measurements and line drawings were made using ZEISS optical microscopy and stereomi- croscopy. Scanning electron microscope observations were made at the Laboratório de Microscopia Eletrônica, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), with JEOL JSM-5800 LV®  equipment, after osmium washing, alcohol battery, critical-point drying with Balzers CPD 30®  (37 °C temperature and
70 kg.cm–2  pressure) equipment and coating with 44 nm gold. The material examined was deposited at the Museu de História Natural (MHN-UNICAMP) under the abbreviations ZUEC-BPO AR or ZUEC-BPO ST. Others abbreviations used in the material examined: VFS (very fine sand), FS (fine sand), CS (coarse sand).
Additional material from BMNH (The Natural History Museum, London, UK), HZM (Zoologisches Institut und Zoologisches Museum der Universität Hamburg, Germany), SMF (Senckenbergmuseum, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), SSM (Swedish Museum of Natural History, Sweden), ZMB (Museum für Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany), ZMUC (Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) was examined as well.

Glycera americana Leidy 1855

Glycera americana Leidy 1855:147-148, pl. 11, Figs. 49-50; Nonato & Luna 1970:71-72, Fig. 26; Orensanz & Gianuca 1974:11; Nonato 1981:103-104 (unpublished thesis); Temperini 1981:28-29 (unpublished thesis); Lana 1984: 92-94, Figs. 84-85 (unpublished thesis); Böggemann 2002: 65-66, Figs. 88-90.

Description (based on additional material): Complete speci- mens measuring from 110 to 230 mm long, 0.6 to 3.8 mm wide, with 51-257 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish. Brown pigment may be present on prostomial rings, lobes and parapodial cirri. Conical prostomium with 9-12 rings (Figure 1a,f); two specimens (AR 497) with prostomium longer than in others. Nuchal organs dorsolaterally on basal ring. Proboscideal papillae of two types (Figure 1g): type 1. numerous conical papillae anteriorly smooth, posteriorly with two U- shaped ridges (Figure 1b,i) and type 2. isolated, broader papillae with- out ridges (Figure 1c,j). Aileron with triangular base, interramal plate present (Figure 1d). Branchiae retractile, bush-like when completely developed and everted, starting from about 15th to 26th parapodia and located dorsally on posterior side of parapodial bases (Figure 1e,h). Mid-body segments bi-annulate. First two parapodia uniramous, with a prechaetal and a postchaetal lobe. Following parapodia biramous with two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length, and two shorter postchaetal lobes, anteriorly rounded, poste- riorly triangular, of about same length or neuropodial slightly shorter than notopodial (Figure 1e,h). Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium,
conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirrus from first parapodium, triangular to digitiform, slightly shorter than postchaetal lobes, in posterior parapodia slender to elon- gated (Figure 1e,h). Last parapodia short and slender. Pygidial cirrus elongated, as long as last ten parapodia. Simple capillary notochaetae and compound spinigerous neurochaetae.
Remarks: The specimens examined by Böggemann (2002) have branchiae located in more anterior chaetigers, between 7 and 22. Glycera cirrata Grube 1857 [partim], Glycera laevis Kinberg 1865, Glycera jucunda Kinberg 1865, Glycera edentata Hansen 1882, and Glycera incerta Hansen 1882 described from specimens collected off Rio de Janeiro were synonymized under Glycera americana by Böggemann (2002). This species has been recorded off the Brazilian coast mainly in ecological studies (Amaral et al. 2006a), and it has been often mistaken for other congeneric species.
Distribution: Atlantic coasts of North and South America, Pacific coasts of South America; Brazil (Alagoas, Sergipe, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul). From intertidal region to 120 m depth; in this study, G. americana was collected from 5.3 to 157 m.


Glycera boeggemanni new species

Material examined
Type Material: holotype ZUEC BPO-AR581 (23° 44.154’ S and 45° 02.007’ W, Caraguatatuba, Sta. 21i, 22.IV.2001, 36.1 m); paratype ZUEC BPO-AR496 (23° 53.026’ S and 45° 30.386’ W, São Sebastião, Sta. 28i, 17.V.2001, 25.6 m).
Description: Holotype incomplete, measuring 68 mm long,
3.5 mm wide (invaginated proboscis), with 112 chaetigers. Paratype incomplete, measuring 71 mm long, 3 mm wide (evaginated probos- cis), divided into two parts, the anterior with 22-26 chaetigers and the posterior with 68-71 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish to brownish. Pigmentation brownish on dorsum and ventrum, except on corporal rings, lobes and cirri. Conical prostomium with about 9-10 rings, as long as first three chaetigers (Figure 2a). Nuchal organs dorsolaterally on basal ring, drop-shaped. Proboscideal papillae of two types (Figures 2c-d, 3a-d): type 1. numerous conical papillae anteriorly smooth, posteriorly with 5-6 U-shaped ridges (Figures 2c,3a-b, d); type 2. isolated, broader, oval to globular papillae posteriorly with
5-6 ridges in U-shaped (Figure 2d, 3c). Aileron with triangular base (Figure 2b, solid interramal plate indicating a larger specimen). Branchiae retractile, up to six branchial rami, located dorsally at base of parapodia; starting from about parapodium 26 (Figure 2f-h). First segments uni-annulated, following bi-annulated; parapodium and dorsal cirrus inserted on anterior ring. First two parapodia uniramous, with a digitiform prechaetal lobe and short, rounded, postchaetal lobe; dorsal cirrus absent, and ventral cirrus short. Following parapodia biramous, with two digitiform prechaetal lobes of same length, and two short rounded postchaetal lobes of same length (Figure 2e-h). Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirrus from first parapodium, triangular, about same length as postchaetal lobes. Parapodia with
7-12 simple capillary notochaetae and 10-16 compound spinigerous neurochaetae, both marginally serrulated (Figures 2 i-j).
Remarks: Glycera boeggemanni n. sp. differs from Glycera robusta Ehlers 1868, its nearest species, mainly in possessing branchiae retractile, up to six branchial rami, in G. boeggemanni n. sp., whereas in G. robusta the branchiae are non-retractile, blister-like; in both species branchiae are located at base on the parapodia. Glycera boeggemanni n. sp. is found in southwest Atlantic, and G. robusta in the western and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Distribution: Brazil (São Paulo: Caraguatatuba and São
Sebastião). From 25 to 36 m depth.
Etymology: The species is named after Markus Böggemann, because of his important work and publications on polychaetes, especially glycerids.


Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870

Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870:61-62; Böggemann 2002

Description (based on additional material): Incomplete speci- men measuring 13 mm long and 2 mm wide, with 44 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish. Pigmentation brownish, less intense on pros- tomial ring and more intense on lobes and dorsal cirri of anterior parapodia. Conical prostomium with about 10 rings, as long as first
15 chaetigers (Figure 4a). Drop-shaped nuchal organ on basal pros- tomial ring. Proboscideal papillae of two types (Figure 4c-d,5a, c-d): type 1. numerous digitiform papillae anteriorly smooth, posteriorly with 8-10 inconspicuous ridges, basally U-shaped and apically V- shaped, and longitudinal lines as intercellular ciliary rootlets; papillae crenulated in lateral view (Figures 4d, 5a,c-d at right); type 2. isolated, broader, smooth papillae with a straight median longitudinal ridge (Figures 4c, 5d at left). Aileron with deeply incised base (Figure 4b). Branchiae absent. First segments biannulated, with parapodium and dorsal cirrus inserted on posterior ring (Figure 4e, 5b); following segments tri-annulated, with parapodium and dorsal cirrus inserted on middle ring. First two parapodia uniramous, with a prechaetal and postchaetal lobe, dorsal cirrus absent (Figure 5b). Following parapodia biramous, with two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes, notopodial slightly shorter than neuropodial lobe (Figure 4e-g,
5b), and two shorter, rounded postchaetal lobes; posterior lobes more elongated and slender (Figure 4g). Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium, digitiform to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base (Figures 4e-g,5b). Ventral cirrus from first parapo- dium, triangular to digitiform, usually longer than the postchaetal lobes and distinctly shorter than the prechaetal lobes (Figure 4e-g). Parapodia with 2-4 capillary simple notochaetae (Figure 4h) and 5-13 spinigerous compound neurochaetae (Figure 4i).

Remarks: The specimens examined by Böggemann (2002)
have 10 to 13 prostomial rings and the papillae type 1 has
6 to 20 ridges. Glycera abranchiata, together with Glycera cirrata Grube 1857 [partim], Glycera martensii Grube 1870, ?Glycera fusiformis Fischli 1900, Glycera edwardsi Gravier 1902, Telake epipolasis Chamberlin 1919 and Glycera spadix Treadwell 1943, have been synonymized with G. brevicirris (Böggemann & Fiege
2001; Böggemann 2002). According to Fauchald (1977) and Gilbert (1984), G. abranchiata (=G. brevicirris) was frequently mistaken for G. tesselata, because it was thought that the former possesses two types of proboscideal papillae and the latter only one type. Glycera brevicirris and G. tesselata have both types, basically differing in relation to the digitiform papillae (type 1). In G. brevicirris these papillae have 6-20 ridges, which are basally U-shaped and apically V-shaped, but they may sometimes be inconspicuous (Böggemann
2002:19) or not present when the papillae are poorly preserved or in juvenile specimens, however wrinkles are always present even if the papillae are not curved. In contrast, G. tesselata has digitiform
papillae with a straight median longitudinal ridge. The parapodia of G. brevicirris are much more elongated and slender than those of G. tesselata, which are broader and shorter (see description and figures of G. tesselata below). According to Böggemann (2002:23), one syntype of G. cirrata Grube 1857 from Rio de Janeiro, that now is lost, in fact may be G. americana (Augener 1934), while the another syntype from St. Croix (Caribbean Sea) is quite different and should be referred to G. brevicirris.

Distribution: Western and eastern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Indo-Pacific, Central Pacific Basin, east Pacific coasts. This study enlarges the distribution of this species, whose southern limit was the Gulf of Mexico, to South America (Brazil, São Paulo). From intertidal zone to 1118 m (Böggemann 2002); in this study, G. brevicirris occurred at 206 m.


Glycera dibranchiata Ehlers 1868
Glycera dibranchiata Ehlers 1868:670-702, pl. 24, Figs. 1, 3-8,
10-28; Böggemann 2002:53-54, Figs. 58-60.

Description: Incomplete specimens measuring from 14 to 140 mm long, 2 to 4.5 mm wide, with 47-182 chaetigers. Coloration from dark yellow to brownish. Conical prostomium with 12-14 rings, as long as the first 10-13 chaetigers (Figure 6a). Nuchal organ a transverse slit and not everted on basal prostomial ring. Proboscis basally with small, oval papillae (Figure 7a), irregularly spaced, with three, almost parallel longitudinal ridge, gradually enlarging towards median and distal region; distally unprovided with papillae (Figure 6b). Probos- cideal papillae of two types (Figure 6e-f, 7b-f): type 1, numerous digitiform papillae with 6-7 ridges, U-shaped basally and V-shaped apically (Figure 6e); type 2, isolated, broader, rounded to oval papil- lae with 3-6 ridges (Figure 6f). Aileron with rounded triangular base; interramal plate small and little translucent (Figure 6c-d). Two simple, digitiform, non-retractile branchiae, starting from about parapodium 16 to 18; upper branchia situated dorsally on parapodial base and lower branchia on anterior side between neuropodial prechaetal lobe and ventral cirrus (Figure 8c-f). Mid-body segments bi-annulate, with parapodium and dorsal cirrus inserted between two rings in anterior region, and on first ring on following segments. First two parapodia uniramous with conical prechaetal lobe, inconspicuous postchaetal lobe and triangular ventral cirrus (Figure 8a). Following parapodia biramous, with two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length (Figure 8b-f), and two shorter postchaetal lobes, more evident from eighth parapodium; shorter, rounded notopodial postchaetal lobe and elongated, triangular neuropodial lobe, both slender in posterior parapodia (Figure 8c-f). Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base (Figure 8b). Ventral cirrus from first parapodium, triangular to digitiform, about same length as neuropodial postcha- etal lobe (Figure 8b-f). Up to 6 simple capillary notochaetae and 26 compound spinigerous neurochaetae (Figure 8g).

Remarks: The branchiae of specimen ZUEC-BPO-ST111 did not present the fibrous muscular appearance of other specimens; rather, each branchia had a large number of gametes, with the lower branchia almost more inflated (Figure 8f). In some parapodia of this speci- men, the branchiae were empty, only the external cuticle remaining. The beginning of the branchiae did not vary much, besides the size differences of the specimens. Böggemann (2002) mentioned 14-17 prostomial rings, branchiae starting from parapodium 13 to 21, and conical proboscideal papillae of type 1 with 4-8 ridges, and of type
2 with 3-6 ridges. A small specimen had the aileron with the outer ramus more curved (Figure 6d).
Distribution: Western and eastern coasts of North and Central America and coast of southern Brazil (São Paulo). From intertidal zone to 403 m; in this study, G. dibranchiata was found from the intertidal zone to 24 m.


Glycera lapidum Quatrefages 1866
Glycera lapidum Quatrefages 1866:187-188; Parra et al. 1995:57; Böggemann 2002:37-40, Figs. 19-21.

Description: Complete specimens measuring 3.0 to 10.6 mm long (juvenile), 0.3 to 1.2 mm wide, with 25 (juvenile) to 52 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish, without pigments apparent. Conical prostomi- um, as long as first nine chaetigers, with about 11 rings, inconspicuous and less distinguishable in adults (Figure 9a); juveniles with eight rings. Proboscideal papillae of two types: type 1. numerous, digitiform papillae (Figure 9d, 10a-c), sometimes with inconspicuous undulating ridge; type 2. isolated, shorter and broader, conical to oval papillae without ridges or with an inconspicuous, straight, median longitudinal ridge when completely distended (Figures 9c, 10b-c). Aileron with slight dent in pointed triangular base (Figure 9b). Branchiae absent. Anterior segments (<8) bi-annulated, median and posterior tri-annu- lated. First two parapodia uniramous; following parapodia biramous, with two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes, notopodial lobe usually up to six times smaller than neuropodial lobe; one shorter, rounded postchaetal lobe (Figure 9e-g). Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium, oval to rounded, inserted dorsolaterally on body wall far from parapodial base. Ventral cirrus from first parapodium triangular to digitiform, slightly smaller than postchaetal lobe (Figure 9e-g). Parapodia with 2-3 simple capillary notochaetae (Figure 9h) and
6-11 compound spinigerous neurochaetae (Figure 9i-j). Pygidium rounded; pygidial cirri not observed.
Remarks: Böggemann (2002) mentioned 9-12 prostomial rings for the species. We examined type and non-type material of Glycera capitata Ørsted 1842 [ZMB Q.4306 (?syntypes), SMF 1605, 2173]. Glycera lapidum and G. capitata have only a single postchaetal lobe on all parapodia, the notopodial prechaetal lobe much shorter than the neuropodial lobe, and branchiae absent. The features used to separate these two species are the shape of the proboscideal papillae and ai- lerons, and the length of the notopodial prechaetal lobe. The shape of the aileron was less variable in the specimens examined here, being nearest to the description of G. lapidum Quatrefages. According to O’Connor (1987), the opening angle of the ramus may vary greatly (45° to 135°). The variations found by this author in the opening angle of both rami at the base, and also in relation to the length of the prechaetal lobe, led him to designate G. lapidum as a complex. However, in the specimens examined here, the opening angle was maintained at about 45° (Figure 9b). In juveniles, because the man- dibular apparatus was incompletely developed, the confirmation of
the species was based on other characters. The proboscideal papillae observed in our specimens are very similar to those described and illustrated by Böggemann (2002:93, Figure 20), although the undulat- ing ridge of the digitiform papilla (type 1) was not as evident as in his specimens. Observations by SEM and light microscope showed that these ridges may be inconspicuous or even absent in the species of Glycera examined, such as G. americana and G. brevicirris, and this may be indicate that the papillae are poorly preserved or the specimens are juvenile and the papillae are still developing. O’Connor (1987) examined 362 specimens and observed proboscideal papillae of two types, tall with crenate edges and oval; and did not mention any undulating ridge. The length of the prechaetal lobes may be, at first glance, a strong feature to distinguish adult specimens of G. lapidum and G. capitata. In the specimens examined here, the notopodial prechaetal lobe is usually up to six times smaller than the neuropodial prechaetal lobe, corresponding to G. lapidum variety A of O’Connor (1987). This same author suggested that Glycera papillosa Grube 1857 and Glycera mimica Hartman, 1965 may be indistinct from G. lapidum, and that the latter could be a variety of G. lapidum in deep waters. According to Böggemann (2002), G. papillosa, the type material of which is probably lost, is a doubtful name, and may be a junior synonym of G. capitata or G. lapidum; and G. mimica is referred to G. capitata. Glycera kerguelensis McIntosh 1885 and G. mimica were synonymized with G. capitata by Böggemann & Fiege (2001), while G. papillosa was designated as incertae sedis.

Distribution: Mainly in temperate zones and sometimes in tropi- cal seas. This is the first record of this species in Brazil (from São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul); it had been previously recorded in the South Atlantic (Argentina). From intertidal to 3947 m depth; in this study, G. lapidum occurred from 60 to 500 m.

Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887
Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887:121-123, pl. 41, Figs. 7-11; Parra et al. 1995: 53-59, Figs 1-3; Böggemann 2002: 40-41, Figs. 22-24.
Glycera cf. oxycephala Lana 1984: 94-95, Figs. 86-87.

Description (based on material examined): Incomplete speci- mens measuring 6 to 23 mm long, 0.6 to 1.8 mm wide, with 35 to
48 chaetigers; only complete specimen (juvenile) with 38 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish, with brownish pigments on dorsum, as trans- verse bands. Conical prostomium as long as first 12 chaetigers; indistinct rings (Figure 11a). Proboscideal papillae of two types: type 1. numerous conical papillae posteriorly with about 12-13 ridges (Figures 11d,12a-b); type 2. isolated, broader, oval to globular papil- lae posteriorly with about 8 ridges (Figures 11c,12b); both smooth anteriorly. Aileron with slightly arched base; interramal plate present (Figure 11b). Branchiae absent. Anterior segments bi-annulated, posterior tri-annulated, with parapodium inserted on second ring. Parapodia short, as long as one-tenth of mid-body width. Up to 9 first
parapodia uniramous (Figure 11e); following parapodia biramous, with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length, or notopodial lobe slightly longer than neuropodial lobe (Figure 11f-h), and one shorter, rounded postchaetal lobe; both lobes slightly more slender in posterior parapodia. Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium, oval to rounded, inserted on body wall near parapodial base (Figure 11e-h). Ventral cirrus from first parapodium, triangular to digitiform, about as long as postchaetal lobe. Parapodia with 2-5 simple capillary notochaetae and 5-10 compound spinigerous neurochaetae. Pygidial cirri, seen in juvenile, elongated and smooth (Figure 11i).

Remarks: Böggemann (2002) mentioned 20-28 prostomial rings, proboscideal papillae of type 1 with 5-20 ridges, and of type 2 with
4-11 ridges. This species belongs to the group of Glycera with two prechaetal lobes and one postchaetal lobe, and no branchiae. Glycera tenuis Hartman 1944, Glycera ehlersi Arwidsson 1899 and, probably, G. capitata var. benguellana Augener 1931 were synonymized with G. oxycephala by Böggemann & Fiege (2001). The features ob- served in our specimens agree with the original description of Ehlers (1887), mainly in relation to the prostomium size, reaching the first
12 chaetigers; parapodia 1/12 of mid-body width, becoming more slender and narrow toward last chaetigers; ante-mid-body prechaetal lobes rounded and unequal, except in posterior region, when neuro- podial lobe becomes slender and two times longer than notopodial lobe; reduced number of chaetae, about 10, between simple and compound; and position of the dorsal cirrus near parapodial base and not far from parapodial base. However, some features observed here differ from G. tenuis (= G. oxycephala) of Hartman (1944), with about 9 parapodia uniramous, instead of almost all of them, indicating juvenile stages. In juveniles, sometimes all parapodia are uniramous, according to Böggemann (2002: 41). In the specimens examined here, the aileron has a hardened interramal plate. In G. cf. oxycephala of Lana (1984), the aileron may be still in development. The number of ridges varies greatly. Hartman (1968) mentioned proboscideal papillae of one type only, with 13-16 ridges in G. tenuis (= G. oxycephala) and 9-10 ridges in G. oxycephala; Fauchald (1977) found 9-10 ridges and Parra et al. (1995), 8-11. Böggemann & Fiege (2001) and Böggemann (2002) described conical papillae with about
5-20 ridges in G. oxycephala. We found, in our specimens, 12-13 and
8 ridges on the papillae of types 1 and 2, respectively. Differences found on the aileron and proboscideal papillae with 15 rings led to the uncertainty of Lana (1984) as to the assignment to G. oxycephala of his specimens from Paraná state.

Distribution: In temperate zones and tropical seas; Brazil (São Paulo and Paraná). From intertidal zone to 2951 m depth; in this study, G. oxycephala occurred between 3 to 165 m.


Glycera tesselata Grube 1863
Glycera tesselata Grube 1863: 41-42, pl. 4, Figs 4, 4a; Böggemann
2002:47-48, Figs 37-39.

Description (based on additional material – AR563): Speci- men almost complete, measuring 15 mm long, 1.5 mm wide, with
44 chaetigers. Coloration yellowish; pigment, if present, brownish on prechaetal lobes and ventral cirri. Conical prostomium as long as first 12 chaetigers; indistinct rings. Proboscideal papillae of two
types: type 1. numerous digitiform papillae posteriorly with straight, median, longitudinal ridge (Figure 13b); type 2. isolated, shorter and broader, conical papillae, posteriorly with more or less distinctly straight, median, longitudinal ridge (Figure 13c); both papillae smooth anteriorly. Aileron with deeply incised base (Figure 13a). Branchiae absent. Segments bi-annulated, with parapodia inserted on first ring. Parapodia 1/4 mid-body width. First two parapodia uniramous, with single prechaetal and postchaetal lobe; following parapodia biramous, with two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length or notopodial lobe slightly shorter than the neuropodial one on anterior to median parapodia (Figure 13d), or notopodial lobe usually slightly shorter than neuropodial lobe on median to posterior parapodia (Figure 13e); two shorter, rounded postchaetal lobes, about same length; both lobes becoming slender on posterior parapodia. Dorsal cirrus from third parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall not far distant from parapodial base (Figure 13d-e). Ventral cirrus triangular to digitiform, shorter than the postchaetal lobes (Fig- ure 13d-e). Parapodia with simple capillary notochaetae (Figure 13f) and compound spinigerous neurochaeta (Figure 13g).

Remarks: Böggemann (2002) mentioned 8-9 prostomial rings, branchiae absent, and digitiform proboscideal papillae with straight, median, longitudinal ridge. It differs from G. brevicirris, the other con- generic species found in Brazil, in the digitiform proboscideal papillae; G. tesselata has only one straight, median, longitudinal ridge, whereas G. brevicirris has about 6-20 transverse ridges. Our specimen has a dorsal cirrus near the parapodial base, differing from that mentioned by Böggemann (2002:48) for this species, i.e., inserted on the body wall far from the parapodial base mainly on anterior part of the body.

Distribution: Northwestern and northeastern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, south coasts of Africa, Indo-Pacific, northwestern Pacific. This is the first occurrence of the species in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). From 2 to 4066 m depth; in this study, G. tesselata occurred at 101 m.

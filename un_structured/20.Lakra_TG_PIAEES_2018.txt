Abstract
Nine species belonging to Glycera were identified (Glycera lapidium Quaterefages 1866; Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887; Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870; Glycera tesselata Grube 1863; Glycera nicobarica Grube 1868; Glycera posterobranchia Hoagland 1920;  Glycera alba O.F.Muller 1776; Glycera africana Arwidsson 1899 and  Glycera tridactyla Schmarda 1861). The materials studied were collected during the macrobenthic inter- tidal  samplings  along  the  South  Andaman  coast.  Eight  of  which  are  new  records  to  the  islands  and confirmation  of  occurance  of  G.tesselata.  The  taxonomic  key  for  identification  of  Glycera  from  South Andaman coast is provided.

Introduction
Glycerids are commonly found in the soft bottom substrate such as sandy or muddy habitats. Though low in abundance, their distributional ranges have been recorded from intertidal to the deep sea (Fauchald 1977). The family Glyceridae Grube 1850 can easily be identified by the presence of prominent conical prostomium with four antennae and along eversible proboscis covered with various types of papillae and presence of two pairs of terminal jaws supported by ailerons. Gonaididae is the only family which commonly shares the similar characters with the Glyceridae. Goniadidae can be distinguished from Glyceridae by the presence of macrognaths and chevrons (Böggemann, 2006). Among all the valid genera of the family Glyceridae, most of the species which have been described represent the genus Glycera Savigny 1818. Böggemann (2002) has given valid status to 36 species under this genus in his detailed revision of the family Glyceridae. Later on, nine new species representing the same genus were described and added to present valid taxa list by various authors (Imajima, 2003, 2009; Rizzo et al., 2007; Böggemann, 2009; Böggemann et al., 2012; Magalhaes and Rizzo, 2012).The species belonging to the genus Glycera are mainly identified by the following characters; type of papillae present on the proboscis, structure of the aileron; shape and number of the prechaetal and postchaetal lobes and presence or absence of branchia on the parapodia and their relative position of origin of branchia with respect to parapodial lobes (Böggemann and Fiege, 2001).
Taxonomic information on Polychaetes diversity from Andaman and Nicobar Islands are scarce. Few authors have worked in this regions (Fauvel, 1953; Tampi and Rangarajan, 1964; Daniel and Ghosh, 1964; Hartman, 1974; Soota and Rao, 1977; Soota et al., 1980; Rajasekaran and Fernando, 2012; Gopal et al., 2014, 2016). The distributional records of six species of Glycerahave been previously reported from the Andaman and Nicobar coast. Glycera cirrata Grube 1857, Glycera prashadi Fauvel 1932, Glycera rouxii Audouin & Milne  Edwards  1833  and  Glycera  tesselata  Grube  1863  have  been  recorded  in  Fauvel  (1953).  In  their annotated checklist of polychaetes from Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Rajasekaran and Fernando (2012) have recorded two Glycera species; Glycera longipinnis Grube1878 and Glycera capitata Örsted 1843. Taxonomic re-evaluation, revision, and validity of the species is required to be addressed in this region. Based on re- description (Böggemann 2002), earlier records of Glycera species (Fauvel, 1953; Rajasekaran and Fernando, 2012) from this region have been re-evaluated and given their valid synonyms and updated to the latest taxonomic validation. In this study, the synonyms have been taken into consideration for the Glycera prashadi Fauvel 1932 validated as Glycera cinnamomea Grube 1874; Glycera longipinnis Grube 1878 as Glycera sphyrabrancha  Schmarda  1861.  Present  study  describes  the  new  distributional  recordes  of  nine  species (Glycera lapidium Quaterefages 1866; Glycera oxycephala Ehlers 1887; Glycera brevicirris Grube 1870; Glycera tesselata Grube 1863; Glycera nicobarica Grube 1868; Glycera posterobranchia Hoagland 1920; Glycera alba O.F.Muller 1776; Glycera africana Arwidsson 1899 and Glycera tridactyla Schmarda 1861) of the genus Glycera and further confirms the occurrence of  G. tesselata Grube 1863 in the Andaman waters.


Materials and Methods
The specimens were collected during the regular macrobenthic samplings for two years (August 2013 to July
2015) across the eleven intertidal regions of different habitats (sandy, sandy-mud and seagrass beds) of the South Andaman coast (Fig.1). Most of the habitats were sand dominated (Table 1). The Polychaete samples were separated using test sieves of mesh size 0.5mm, fixed initially with 5% formalin solution and then later on transferred to 70% ethanol for long term preservation and further taxonomic studies. The classification used in this study is based on the taxonomic revision accomplished by Böggemann (2002). The Morphological characters and counts were first observed under a stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ 1500). The Parapodia,Papillae were dissected and mounted on temporary slides using glycerol. For each specimen  10 individuals were taken and dissected various parts  to be observed under microscope.  Line drawings were made using stereomicroscope and Olympus compound microscope BX41 and CX31. The examined materials are deposited in the National Zoological collections at the Zoological Survey of India regional center Port Blair, National Repository center, Govt. of India.

Glycera lapidum Quaterefages 1866. Fig. 2, a-g.
Glycera lapidum Quaterefages 1866:187-188; Böggemann 2002:37-40, Figs. 19-21.
Diagnosis:  Proboscidal  papillae  digitiform  with  undulating  ridges.  One  postchaetal  lobe,  neuropodial prechaetal lobe longer than the notopodial prechaetal lobe. Aileron with a pointed triangular base with a slight dent. Dorsal cirri inserted away from the parapodia base. Branchia is absent.
Description: Registration no ZSI/ANRC-16990. Complete specimen measuring 14mm with 39 segments. Body rings in anterior regions are bi-annulated, mid-body segments are more or less tri-annulated. Four antennae present in the tip of the prostomium. Elongated conical prostomium which is longer than width consisting of 10-12 indistinct rings. Proboscis with four curved chitinous jaws on its anterior margin which is followed by soft papillae, comprises of two distinct types. Most papillae are digitiform shape of various lengths with undulating ridges. The rest of the papillae are conical shape which resemble oval shape without any ridges. Aileron with a pointed triangular base with a slight dent. First two setigers are uniramous followed by  biramous  parapodia.  Parapodia  consists  of  two  prechaetal  lobes  and  a  single  postchaetal  lobe.  The notopodial prechaetal lobe remains shorter than the prechaetal lobe of the neuropodia throughout the body. In the anterior and mid-body segments, the neuropodial prechaetal lobe is present with abroad base in relation to the notopodial prechaetal lobe. In the last segments, the prechaetal lobe of noto and neuropodia is seen in the digitiform shape. The postchaetal lobe is short and rounded throughout the body. Dorsal cirrus is conical to
oval shape present from 3rd segments onwards inserted far away from the parapodia basis. The ventral cirrus is
broadly triangular in the anterior and mid-body regions, but in the posterior end, it transforms to digitiform shape. In the last segment, the length of the ventral cirrus is as equal to the neuropodial prechaetal lobe. Simple capillaries in notopodia and compound spinigers are present in neuropodia. Branchia is absent.
Remarks: The morphological characters of papillae and parapodia confirms the specimen G.lapidum. G.capitata and G.lapidum are quite similar, which may leads to misidentification. The difference between them is the arrangement of ridges on the digitiform papillae. Rajasekaran and Fernando (2012) recorded G.capitata from Andaman and Nicobar region. There is a chance of misidentification of their report, since G.capitata is known to occure and recorded from the cold waters only (personal communication M. Böggemann). Their specimens were not deposited in the National Center and hence the validity could not be concluded.
Distribution: Mostly in temperate waters, tropics of indo-pacific. Recorded fromthe Andaman Sea, New record to the Andaman coast.

The ventral cirrus is broadly triangular in the anterior and mid-body regions, but in the posterior end it transforms to digitiform shape. The ventral cirrus is broadly triangular in the anterior and mid-body regions, but in the posterior end, it transforms to digitiform shape. Non-retractile digitiform branchia is present between 17-22rd segment, termino-dorsally on the parapodia to the posterior end. Simple capillaries in notopodia and compound spinigers are present in neuropodia.
Distribution: West coasts of Europe, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Coasts of South Africa, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Coasts of Japan, East and South China Sea, Coasts of New Guinea, East coast of Australia, Andaman Sea, and New record to Andaman coast.


Discussion
The present study supports the statement that, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are highly diverse and understudied. Most of the researchers worked from this coast, have followed the taxonomic literature of adjacent waters (Day, 1967a, b, 1973; Fauvel, 1932, 1939, 1953; Hartman, 1974; Southern, 1921). The taxonomic literature for the Andaman Sea is few.   Thai-Danish BIOSHELF project undertaken by Phuket Marine Biological Centre provided a useful taxonomic information and established remarkable contribution for the Andaman Sea. The records of Glyceridae and Goniadidae by Böggemann and Jacobsen (2002) is a earmark study which is the first comprehensive taxonomic work of its own kind from the Andaman Sea and further comprehended our understanding of polychaete species distributionand and diversity in the region. In 1953
Fauvel documented G.rouxii Audouin and Milne-Edwards 1883 and G.cirrata Grube 1869 from the Andaman Islands. After taxonomic revision, it was clear that the resemblance of G.rouxii is quiet similar to that of G.nicobarica  and  G.cirrata  to  G.cinnamomea  (see  Böggemann  and  Eibye-Jacobsen,  2002).  This  study supports  that  the  similar  Glycera  sps.  are  distributed  along  the  Andaman  coast.  Most  of  the  species documented in the present study are already documented from the Thailand coast (Böggemann and Eibye- Jacobsen, 2002).

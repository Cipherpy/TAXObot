The postchaetal lobe is rounded. The dorsal cirrus is digitiform, slightly swollen dorsally at the base, longer on anterior and parapodial segments, decreasing in size towards the posterior. The ventral cirrus varies from triangular on anterior segments, digitiform in the middle, to slender on posterior segments. Branchiae are non-retractile, simple, slightly triangular anteriorly, becoming digitiform from the middle of the anterior region, most prominent in the middle body. They appear starting from chaetiger 15 near the upper chaetal lobe. The chaetae include simple capillaries in notopodia and compound spinigers in neuropodia. The type locality is the Jamaican EEZ, and the species distribution includes the Arabian Gulf, Andaman Sea, Aruba, Belize, Caribbean Sea, Cuba, Curaçao, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Philippines, Red Sea, South Africa, South China Sea, Tobago, Trinidad, Venezuela, and regions in India such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa, Kerala, Lakshadweep Islands, Maharashtra, Odisha, and West Bengal.",<concise> Support: <1-2 lines>,<concise>,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
What are the taxonomic characteristics of Glycera tesselata?,"Glycera tesselata Grube, 1863 is characterized by body rings that are bi-annulated in the anterior segments and more or less tri-annulated in the mid-body segments. The prostomium is conical with 8-9 rings. The proboscidal papillae include two types: mostly digitiform-shaped papillae, with the aileron featuring a deeply incised base. The parapodia initially uniramious, become biramous in the following segments. The prechaetal lobe, triangular with an broad anterior base in the front and mid-body, short and rounded in the posterior segments. The postchaetal lobe remains short and rounded across all segments. The dorsal cirrus, conical to oval, appears from the 3rd segment onward, positioned far from the parapodial basis. The branchiae are absent. The chaetae include simple capillaries in the notopodia and compound spinigers in the neuropodia. The ventral cirrus, broadly triangular at the front and middle, becomes digitiform towards the rear. The type locality is the Mediterranean Sea. Its distribution includes the Northwestern and Northeastern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, southern coasts of Africa, Indo-Pacific, Northwestern Pacific, as well as India Bay of Bangla, Arabian Sea, North Indian Ocean, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",<concise> Support: <1-2 lines>,<concise>,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
What are the taxonomic characteristics of Glycera tridactyla?,"Glycera tridactyla Schmarda, 1861: The body rings are described as bi-annulated in the mid-body segments. The prostomium is conical with 11-14 rings. The proboscidal papillae consist of three types: 1) terminal fingernail-shaped papillae with short stalks and longitudinal ridges, 2) digitiform papillae with longitudinal ridges, and 3) oval-shaped papillae without ridges. The aileron has a pointed triangular base. The parapodia first appear uniramous, then become biramous. The prechaetal lobes are triangular with a broad base in the anterior and mid-body regions and become digitiform in posterior segments. The postchaetal lobes are short; notopodial lobes are triangular and longer than the rounded neuropodial lobes. The dorsal cirrus is conical to oval-shaped, located close to the parapodial base from the 3rd segment onward. Non-retractile digitiform branchiae are present between segments 17 and 22, positioned terminodorsally on the parapodia extending to the posterior end. The chaetae are simple capillaries in notopodia and compound spinigers in neuropodia. The ventral cirrus is broadly triangular in the anterior and mid-body, transforming into digitiform shape towards the posterior. The type locality is the Atlantic Ocean. Its geographic distribution includes the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, South Africa, Red Sea, Japan coast, South China Sea, New Guinea, Australia, Andaman Sea, and various locations around India such as the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Andaman coast.",<concise> Support: <1-2 lines>,<concise>,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
What are the taxonomic characteristics of Glycera unicornis?,"Glycera unicornis Lamarck, 1818, has body rings characterized by mid-body segments that are biannulate, with the anterior annulus roughly as long as or slightly longer than the posterior one. The prostomium is conical and bears 10-13 rings. Its proboscidal papillae consist of two types: numerous conical papillae with three U-shaped ridges, and isolated, broader oval to globular papillae without ridges. The aileron features a triangular base. Parapodia first appear uniramous for the initial two segments, then become biramous thereafter. The prechaetal lobe comprises two slender, triangular to digitiform lobes, while the postchaetal lobes are two in number, shorter, and rounded anteriorly; in subsequent segments, these lobes are elongated, slender, and roughly the same length. The dorsal cirrus, starting from the second parapodium, varies from conical to oval. Branchiae are retractile, with 1-2 digitiform branchial rami, and are positioned from about the 16th to the 30th parapodium near the posterior end. Chaetae include simple capillaries in the notopodia and compound spinigers in the neuropodia. The ventral cirrus is slender, triangular to digitiform, and approximately as long as the postchaetal lobes. The type locality is unknown. Its geographic distribution spans the Andaman Sea, Black Sea, North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Madagascar, South China Sea, Java Sea, and regions in India such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and the Andaman coast.",<concise> Support: <1-2 lines>,<concise>,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

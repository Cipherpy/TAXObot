32,GQ,Why is buffered formalin preferred over unbuffered formalin?,Because buffering prevents acid formation that can damage hard tissues,"---

Answer: Buffered formalin is preferred over unbuffered formalin for marine specimen preservation because it neutralises formic acid, preventing demineralisation of hard tissues and minimising the risk of tissue damage.

Support: [chunk_000074] Formalin, used as a 5-10% aqueous solution, is an effective general preservative for marine specimens. However, it tends to stiffen and harden specimens, making them brittle and difficult to handle. To prevent demineralisation of hard tissues and minimise tissue damage, buffered formalin is preferred.

66,GQ,Why is integrating qualitative and quantitative sampling beneficial?,It combines species identification with statistically robust population data,"---

Answer: Integrating qualitative and quantitative sampling methods in marine research is beneficial because it combines the advantages of both approaches. Qualitative sampling, such as visual observations, hand picking, and opportunistic sampling, is valuable for species identification, habitat characterisation, and the collection of reference materials. It is particularly useful in understudied or cryptic marine environments and for documenting rare, fragile, or elusive species. Quantitative sampling, on the other hand, provides the necessary statistical framework for population assessments and ecological modelling. It is essential for monitoring changes in biodiversity, assessing the impact of human activities, and supporting conservation and restoration efforts. By combining these techniques, researchers can ensure accurate species documentation, inform management strategies, and enhance the effectiveness of MPAs.

Support: Qualitative sampling focuses on species presence, diversity, and ecological interactions, while quantitative sampling focuses on population estimates and statistical analysis. Combining these methods allows for a more comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystems.

141,GQ,Which fishing method uses heavy metal frames dragged along the seabed?,Dredging,"Suction sampling is a non-destructive method that minimises disturbance to the seafloor and the organisms living there. By gently sucking up sediment or water, the sampling device avoids damaging delicate organisms and preserves their natural habitat. This method is particularly useful for collecting samples from areas with sensitive or rare species, as it reduces the risk of accidental damage or contamination.
To ensure accurate and representative sampling, suction sampling devices are often equipped with filters or screens to remove larger debris and unwanted particles. This refinement process ensures that only the desired sample is collected, reducing the amount of post-processing required in the laboratory.
The versatility of suction sampling extends beyond deep-sea environments. It is also used in shallow water ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, to collect samples of sediment, microorganisms, and small invertebrates. This method is essential for understanding the ecological processes and biodiversity of these important habitats.

143,GQ,What distinguishes pelagic trawling from bottom trawling?,It operates in the water column,"The vacuuming system consists of a flexible hose connected to a vacuum pump on the surface, with a collection bag attached to the hose's end. The vacuum pump creates a negative pressure inside the bag, drawing water and organisms into it as the diver moves the hose through the water. The vacuuming process is gentle, as the water flow is controlled by the diver, allowing them to target specific areas and avoid damaging delicate organisms.
The collected samples are then transported to the surface for further processing, such as sorting, identification, and preservation. Underwater vacuuming is an essential tool for marine researchers, as it enables them to collect valuable data on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of marine organisms without causing significant damage to their habitats. This technique is particularly useful in sensitive environments, such as coral reefs, where traditional sampling methods may be harmful.

Belt transects can be conducted using various platforms, including SCUBA diving, snorkelling, or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The choice of platform depends on the habitat depth, accessibility, and survey objectives. For shallow waters, snorkelling or SCUBA diving is often sufficient, while deeper waters require the use of ROVs. Regardless of the platform, careful standardisation is essential to ensure accurate and consistent data collection. This includes the use of standardised transect lines, consistent observation methods, and precise recording techniques.
The belt transect method","To implement the belt transect method, researchers follow a predetermined transect line, typically marked by flags or buoys, and record observations within a fixed-width belt along the line. This belt can be marked using tape or ropes, with the width depending on the habitat and survey objectives. Observers record data on species presence, abundance, and size, as well as environmental conditions such as water depth, temperature, and substrate type. For mobile organisms, such as fish, observers may use underwater visual census techniques, such as point counts or quadrat surveys, to estimate population densities.

204,GQ,Why are Niskin bottles attached to CTDs?,To collect water samples at set depths,"Propylene phenoxetol is a versatile anaesthetic and preservative, offering several advantages over other chemicals. Its relatively low toxicity makes it safer for researchers to handle, and its broad applicability to various invertebrate groups simplifies the process of collecting and preparing specimens for taxonomic, ecological, and physiological investigations. Additionally, its ability to serve both as an anaesthetic and a post-fixative streamlines the workflow, reducing the need for multiple chemical treatments and minimising the risk of cross-contamination.

22,GQ,Why is eDNA sampling considered non-invasive?,It detects species without capturing them,"---

Answer: eDNA sampling is considered non-invasive because it involves collecting genetic material from environmental samples, such as sediments and seawater, rather than directly from individual organisms. Organisms release DNA through various means, including faeces, mucus, gametes, shed skin, carcasses, and other body parts, which accumulates in the environment and can be sequenced to reveal information about the species present in an ecosystem. This method offers several advantages over traditional methods for assessing species richness and abundance, including being non-destructive to habitats, less labour-intensive, and able to detect small, rare, or elusive species that might otherwise go undetected.

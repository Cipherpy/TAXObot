0,MCQ,Which species is characterized by the following Pharynx: To setiger 5; dorsal tooth present?,Exogone normalis,"---

Based on the provided context, the answer is:
Answer: Pontogenia chrysocoma
Explanation: The described species has a brown body, up to 40 mm long, and 19 setigers. It has two long achaetous preanals, the first one being twice the length of the second. The prostomium is rounded and has numerous eye-spots present. The cephalic plate has a high anterior rim and is divided posteriorly into about eight crenulations. The glandular pattern includes broad glandular bands on setigers 1-7 and a broad mid-ventral glandular streak on setigers 7-14. The pygidium has a circular ridge and funnel with numerous short anal cirri and a small ventral valve. The notosetae are capillary setae, and the neurosetae have hooks with vertical series of 4-5 teeth above the main fang and well-developed tendons. This species is distributed in the Mediterranean, Zanzibar, Madagascar, and Morocco.

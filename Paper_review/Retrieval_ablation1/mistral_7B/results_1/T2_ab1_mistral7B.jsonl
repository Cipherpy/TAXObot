Branchiae are present on segments 3-20 with ~3 small branchial papillae each, and nephridial papillae are well developed. Notosetae are numerous, long, fine, silky, with blades completely ringed by minute spinules, and neurosetae are stout, unidentate, with long fine spinules giving the blades a distinctly bearded appearance. The species is found in the South Africa (Cape region) and deeper waters.\n\nSupport", "final_answer_citations": [], "invalid_citations_removed": [], "llm_model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "temperature": 0.0}

They are adapted to life in sandy or muddy substrates and have pointed tube feet for digging. Luidia species practice sexual or asexual reproduction and play a crucial role in controlling benthic invertebrate populations and maintaining the health of benthic communities.\n\nCitations: chunk_000116, chunk_000379, chunk_000188, chunk_00", "final_answer_citations": [], "invalid_citations_removed": [], "llm_model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "temperature": 0.0}

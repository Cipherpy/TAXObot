These species share some similarities with the diagnostic characters given, such as medium-sized bodies, rounded anterior segments, and dorsally flattened posterior segments. Additionally, they have anterior regions with brown transverse bars and tubes reinforced with mud. However, each species has unique characteristics that distinguish it from the others. For example, Nothria conchylega has a cordate prostomium with a central brown spot and short ceratophores with 3-4 rings, while Lumbrineris papillifera has a conical prostomium and long, kite-shaped maxillary supports. Lumbrineris heteropoda difficilis has a conical prostomium with dark pigmentation at the base and long, digitiform posterior feet with very long postsetal lobes.

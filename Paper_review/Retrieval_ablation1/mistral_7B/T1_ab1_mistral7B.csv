Answer: The described species is likely Harmothoe hystrix based on its oval, depressed body, 32-34 setigers, small rounded prostomium with a slender median antena, swollen ommatophores with two eye spots, and the presence of long harpoon-setae on clytrigerous feet and smaller, non-harpoon setae on cirrigerous feet.

Support: The species matches the description in chunk_000138.

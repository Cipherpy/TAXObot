Its large, stalked, pear-shaped anterior eyes contrast with tiny, sessile posterior eyes located at the bases of ommatophores. The oval, smooth, brownish elytra feature margins that curl upward, forming shallow pockets, and do not meet across the back. Few very fine, minutely spinulose notosetae are present, along with a varied set of neurosetae including short, fine capillaries; long pseudopenicillate ‘‘paint-brush’’ setae; thick aristate setae with blunt or hairy subterminal ends; and slender, recurved, spirally serrated inferior setae. The parapodia show notopodia as anterior dorsal folds and very stout neuropodia. The species is tubicolous, burrowing in sandy mud. The first segment forms a small occipital fold, with the first parapodium elongated, directed forward, and bearing tentacular cirri and fine setae. The median antenna tapers to about the length of the prostomium; lateral antennae are slightly shorter and often hidden. The long, banded palps are positioned at the front. Internal coiled spinning glands open between noto- and neuropodia from around setiger 8 onward. Its distribution includes the Indo-Pacific, tropical West Africa (from Senegal to Congo), and records from Mozambique.","Polyodontes melanonotus is a large, elongate, tubicolous polychaete worm (up to 300 mm) with a bilobed prostomium, three antennae (median dorsal, laterals terminal), and stalked anterior eyes. It has branchial vesicles on anterior feet, numerous small elytra along the body, and three types of neurosetae (superior ""pseudopenicillate"", middle aristate, inferior spirally serrated). The notosetae are few, slender, and serrated. It belongs to the subfamily Polyodontinae (Aphroditidae) and is distinguished by its tube-building and scavenging habits.

The notosetae consist of three main types: harpoon-shaped setae, spurred setae with 2–4 serrations on the longer prong, and a few long spurred setae with tiny serrations or steps on the blade. The neurosetae are mainly stout spurred setae with more developed spurs and serrations than notosetae, along with a few long, fine spurred setae featuring minute serrations. Dorsal cirri are long and tapered. Its ecology involves living on rocks and old shells. Branchiae start from setiger 2, each with 4–7 finger-like filaments. The prostomium caruncle is sinuous and elongated, attached to setiger 2 and overlapping setigers 3–4. Geographically, it is found in southern Chile and Tristan da Cunha, and has been recorded from the Cape region of South Africa.","Eurythoe chilensis is a small polychaete (up to 25 mm, 50 segments) with a sinuous, elongate caruncle attached to setiger 2 and overlapping setiger 3 or 4.

The dorsal and ventral cirri are small and biarticulate. The first 5–6 parapodia lack setigerous lobes, while subsequent ones have elongated lobes supported by an aciculum; adults do not have setae. This species inhabits surf beaches and is locally common. The pygidium has a pair of long cirri. The peristome is fused to the prostomium, featuring two pairs of long tentacular cirri and a ventral slit at the level of the tentacular cirri. The pharynx contains marginal papillae and two pairs of small, lightly chitinized jaws. Reproductively, the sexes are separate: males have sperm-filled segments and a club-shaped vesicula seminalis opening on a large genital papilla (copulatory organ), while females possess a receptaculum seminis opening below the parapodium and a series of median ventral genital suckers. Geographically, the species is found in India and has also been recorded from Natal, South Africa.","Pisionidens indica is an elongate, slender, depressed worm (~25 mm, 70 segments) with a well-developed prostomium bearing a pair of frontal antennae, lateral palps with basal sheaths, and four subdermal eyes.

The superior prechaetal lobe is small, while the inferior is large and pointed. A single, rounded postchaetal lobe is present. The small dorsal cirrus arises from the body wall above the parapodium. No branchiae are present or located. The chaetae include simple capillaries in notopodia and compound spinigers in neuropodia. The ventral cirrus has a length comparable to the postchaetal lobe. The type locality is in the Chilean part of the South Pacific Ocean. Its distribution spans the Western Atlantic from North Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico, Chile, Western Africa, and the Indian Ocean including the South Arabian Sea and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.","Glycera papillosa is a small species (20–30 mm long) with a prostomium of about eight rings.

ABSTRACT
A total of 243 specimens of Glyceridae and 186 specimens of Goniadidae were collected during the Thai–Danish BIOSHELF Project in the Andaman Sea portion of Thai national waters in 1996 and 1997. Eleven species of Glyceridae were found, of which Glycera macrobranchia (Moore, 1911), G. onomichiensis Izuka, 1912, G. posterobranchia Hoagland, 1920 and Hemipodia simplex (Grube, 1857) are newly reported for the Indian Ocean; Glycera brevicirris Grube, 1870, G. lapidum Quatrefages,1866 and G. sphyrabrancha Schmarda, 1861 are new reports for the Andaman Sea; G. oxycephala Ehlers, 1887 is new for Thailand. Twelve species of Goniadidae (ten named) were found, of which Goniadides carolinae Day, 1973 (sensu Gilbert 1984) and Ophioglycera lyra Granados-Barba and Solís- Weiss, 1997 are newly reported for the Indian Ocean. Glycinde anuwati n. sp., Goniada apisiti n. sp., Goniada hexadentes n. sp. and Goniada amacrognatha n. sp. are newly described. The last-mentioned species is unique among goniadids in lacking macrognaths on the proboscis. Scanning electron micrographs of the proboscidial papillae and other proboscidial organs are presented for ten species of goniadids. Keys are provided to the Glyceridae and Goniadidae that are known from the Andaman Sea.


INTRODUCTION

There is very little information in the literature on the Glyceridae and Goniadidae of the Andaman Sea. Prior to the Thai–Danish BIOSHELF Project local workers have had to rely on species lists, descriptions and illustrations provided in papers based on material from neighbouring regions in South and Southeast Asia (e.g., Day 1973a; Fauvel
1932, 1933, 1939, 1953; Gallardo 1968; Grube
1874, 1878; Hartman 1974; Hoagland 1920; Michaelsen 1892, Silva 1965; Southern 1921). A notable exception is the species list published by Phasuk (1992) on material collected during the Fifth Thai–Danish Expedition along the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. This list provides no details, apart from a tabulation of the stations at which each species was collected, but much of Phasuk’s original material is available for study at the Marine Biodiversity Unit of the Phuket Marine Biological Center (PMBC).
The Glyceridae and Goniadidae are slender, cylindrical polychaetes that can reach considerable sizes (probably up to 1 m long). They are widely distributed endopsammal benthic organisms and occur from intertidal to abyssal depths. The body is elongated, tapering at both ends and consists of numerous segments. Both families are easily recognized by their long, muscular, eversible proboscis and the pointed, usually annulated prostomium. The anteriormost annulus of the prostomium bears four appendages and the posteriormost annulus one pair of nuchal organs; in some species of the goniadids a subdistal and/ or basal pair of subdermal eyes is present, whereas the glycerids have no eyes. The characteristic red- dish colour and the four dark jaws with ailerons, arranged in a cross and situated terminally on the proboscis, separate the glycerids from the closely related goniadids with their more iridescent integument and a proboscis that bears a terminal ring of macro- and micrognaths and in several genera also a lateral row of chevrons on each side (macrognaths may be absent, see Goniada amacrognatha n. sp.).
Glycerids and goniadids are generally considered to be carnivorous (Fauchald and Jumars 1979). Glycerids capture their prey with the four jaws situated at the end of the eversible proboscis, killing it by the injection of venom (Ockelmann and Vahl 1970; Manaranche, Thieffry and Israel 1980), whereas goniadids use their macro- and micrognaths to grasp their prey; chevrons, when present, probably aid in retention of the prey during swallowing. Most species form semi-permanent burrow systems in soft substrates (Ockelmann and Vahl 1970; Mattson 1981), but some species have been encountered living under rocks or crawling on algae (Fauchald and Jumars
1979). The family Glyceridae was formally established by Grube (1850) as Glycerea, including the two genera Glycera and Goniada. Kinberg (1865) pointed out the distinguishing characters between glycerids and goniadids and established the separate family Goniadidae (as Goniadea). The independence of these two families was controversial for a long time (Ehlers 1868; Fauvel
1923), until Hartman (1950) underlined the clear differences between them.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Material was fixed in 10% formalin diluted with seawater and later transferred to 80 % ethanol. Observations, drawings and measurements were made using a Leica MS 5 and a Leica MZ APO stereo microscope and a Zeiss Axioskop com- pound microscope. For SEM observations specimens were dehydrated via a graded ethanol and acetone series, critical-point dried using CO2, mounted on aluminium stubs and subsequently sputter-coated with gold. Observations were performed with a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope.
The lists of examined material provided for each species include only specimens from BIOSHELF stations; the number of specimens from any given station and information on where they have been deposited follows in parentheses.
Other, non-BIOSHELF specimens that have been studied are listed in the Remarks sections as appropriate. The descriptions given below are based on the material from the BIOSHELF Project, i.e., specimens from Thailand, unless otherwise stated. A more detailed list of the BIOSHELF stations is provided in Aungtonya and Eibye- Jacobsen (2002).

SYSTEMATIC SECTION 

Glyceridae Grube, 1850
Type genus: Glycera Savigny, 1818: 314, by original designation.
Diagnosis: Body with numerous segments, elongate, tapering at both ends. Segments bi- or triannulate. Prostomium conical, mostly pointed, distinctly annulated; anteriormost annulus with four appendages, anterior pair situated termino- laterally and posterior pair more dorso-laterally; posteriormost annulus with one pair of nuchal organs; eyes absent. Proboscis long, cylindrical to club-shaped, muscular, densely covered with numerous papillae bearing specialized structures on their posterior sides; tip of everted proboscis with four dark, hook-like curved jaws, each with a rod-like, more or less triangular or deeply incised supportive aileron. First two parapodia usually uniramous, consisting of neuropodia, ventral cirri and compound chaetae only; following parapodia uni- or biramous with dorsal and ventral cirri;largest parapodia in mid-body region; in biramous parapodia notopodia and neuropodia indistinctly separated from each other; each parapodium with two prechaetal and one or two postchaetal lobes. Branchiae present or absent, blister-like to simple digitiform or branched, retractile in some species; located on different parts of parapodia. Noto- and neuropodia each with a single acicula; notopodia with simple capillaries, neuropodia usually with spinigerous compound chaetae only. Pygidium with a pair of slender anal cirri.
Remarks: The Glyceridae have recently been revised (Böggemann and Fiege 2001; Böggemann in press). For this reason, very few figures are provided of glycerids in the present paper. The ultrastructure of the proboscidial papillae in five species of Glycera has recently been described by Böggemann, Fiege and Purschke (2000).

Glycera Savigny, 1818
Type species: Glycera unicornis Savigny, 1818:
315, by monotypy.

Glycera alba (O.F. Müller, 1776) 
Description: Body up to 25 mm long with up to
84 segments. Mid-body segments biannulate. Conical prostomium consisting of about 9–11 rings. Proboscis with three types of papillae: 1. numerous papillae with terminal fingernail structure with long stalk and some longitudinal ridges on nail (Fig. 1A); 2. less numerous digitiform papillae with straight, median longitudinal ridge;
3. isolated, broader, oval to globular papillae without ridges. Ailerons with pointed triangular base. First two parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length. Two shorter post- chaetal lobes: slender triangular notopodial and shorter, more or less rounded neuropodial lobe. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender, triangular to digitiform, about as long as neuropodial postchaetal lobe; in posterior parapodia slender and elongated; in last parapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal
lobe; situated medio-ventrally on parapodia. Branchiae non-retractile, simple, digitiform; from about parapodium 17–23 to near posterior end; situated termino-dorsally on parapodia; best developed in mid-body region, about as long as prechaetal lobes.
Remarks: Branchiae may be absent or not fully developed in juvenile specimens. Specimens from the Andaman Sea show no morphological differences, including details of the proboscidial papillae, from European animals (Fiege and Böggemann 1997; Böggemann in press). Animals from the BIOSHELF Project were compared to specimens reported by Wesenberg-Lund (1949) from the Persian Gulf (N of Bushire, N of Qais, Strait of Hormus, Gulf of Oman) and are considered to be identical.
Glycera alba has previously been reported from the Andaman Sea (Phasuk 1992). The identity of one of these samples (st. 1035, PMBC 12646) was confirmed during this study. Furthermore, one of the 6 lots reported as G. tesselata by Phasuk (st. 1007, PMBC 12545) consisted of one specimen of G. alba; thus, among other characters, the pro- boscidial papillae bear a terminal nail.
Distribution: Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Atlantic coasts of Europe, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Indian Ocean around Madagascar, Andaman Sea, E and S China Sea; NW Pacific coasts; 9–199 m.


Glycera brevicirris Grube, 1870
Description: Body up to 64 mm long with up to
143 segments. Mid-body segments biannulate. Conical prostomium consisting of about 12–13 rings. Proboscis with two types of papillae: 1. numerous digitiform papillae with about 6–20 ridges; ridges U-shaped basally and V-shaped apically; 2. isolated, slightly shorter and broader, conical papillae with more or less straight, median longitudinal ridge. Ailerons with deeply incised base. First two parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes: neuropodial lobe usually slightly longer and broader than notopodial lobe. Two shorter, rounded, postchaetal lobes. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, about as long as postchaetal lobes; in posterior parapodia slender and elongated; in last parapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal lobe; situated medio- ventrally on parapodia.

21–32 to near posterior end; situated dorsally on parapodial bases; best developed in mid-body region, about as long as prechaetal lobes.
Remarks: This species (as Glycera prashadi Fauvel, 1932) has previously been reported from the Andaman Sea (Phasuk 1992). However, this report was based on a specimen (st. 1024, PMBC
13618) that, despite being over 25 mm long, shows no signs of having gills; it is here referred to G. onomichiensis Izuka, 1912.

Remarks: Phasuk (1992) reported Glycera chirori Izuka, 1912 from the Andaman Sea. Two of the original 6 lots were available for study; one of them (st. 1116, PMBC 13609) contains a typical specimen of G. nicobarica, whereas the other one (st. 1010, PMBC 13610) contains a poorly pre- served  specimen  of  Glycera ,  possibly  G. brevicirris Grube, 1870, as the ailerons are deeply incised, without an interramal plate.
Phasuk (1992) also reported Glycera gigantea Quatrefages, 1866 from the Andaman Sea; 4 of the original 6 lots were studied and two of these (st. 1020, PMBC 12597 and st. 1027, PMBC 12599) each contain one juvenile specimen in which the dorsal postchaetal lobe is elongate and conical rather than short and rounded as in G. gigantea (= G. fallax Quatrefages, 1850). These specimens are here referred with doubt to G. nicobarica. One of the other lots contains a specimen of G. onomichiensis Izuka, 1912 (q.v.) and the final lot (st. 1006, PMBC 13612) contains a polynoid polychaete, obviously the result of a sorting error.
Among the 6 lots of Glycera tesselata Grube, 863 reported from the Andaman Sea by Phasuk (1992), one of them (st. 1023, PMBC 12542) contains a specimen of G. nicobarica.
Distribution: Indian Ocean, Andaman Sea, Indo- Pacific, E and S China Sea, Japan; intertidal to
143 m.


Glycera onomichiensis Izuka, 1912

Proboscis with three types of papillae: 1. numerous papillae with terminal fingernail structure with long stalk and some longitudinal ridges on nail; 2. less numerous digitiform papillae with straight, median, longitudinal ridge; 3. isolated, broader, oval to globular papillae without ridges. Ailerons with pointed triangular base. First two parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length; notopodial lobe usually slightly broader than neuropodial lobe. Two shorter, slender triangular postchaetal lobes of about same length. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, slightly shorter than postchaetal lobes; in posterior parapodia slender and elongated; in last parapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal lobe; situated medio-ventrally on parapodia. Branchiae absent.
Remarks: Glycera prashadi Fauvel, 1932 was reported from the Andaman Sea by Phasuk (1992); however, the specimen in question (st. 1024, PMBC 13618) is rather large, over 25 mm long, but shows no signs of gills and is here referred to G. onomichiensis. hasuk (1992) also reported Glycera gigantea Quatrefages, 1866 from the Andaman Sea; of the original 6 lots four were available for study and one of these (st. 1006, PMBC 12598) contains one specimen of G. onomichiensis.
Distribution: W Pacific, Andaman Sea; intertidal to 301 m. New record for the Indian Ocean.


Glycera oxycephala Ehlers, 1887
Description: Body at least 40 mm long with at least 96 segments. Anterior segments biannulate; mid-body segments triannulate. Long, conical prostomium consisting of about 20–28 rings. Proboscis with two types of papillae: 1. numerous conical papillae with 5–20 ridges; 2. isolated, broader, oval to globular papillae with 4–11 ridges; ridges U-shaped basally and V-shaped apically. Ailerons with slightly arched base. In largest specimen only first two parapodia reduced, otherwise up to 13 parapodia uniramous; following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length or sometimes with neuropodial lobe slightly longer and broader than notopodial lobe. One shorter, rounded postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, oval to globular, inserted near parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, about as long as postchaetal lobe; in posterior parapodia slender and elongated; in last parapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal lobe; situated near para- podial base. Branchiae absent.
Remarks: The number of anterior uniramous parapodia with only compound chaetae and one acicula seems to be more or less dependent on the size of the specimens.
Phasuk (1992) reported Glycera tesselata
Grube, 1863 from the Andaman Sea. Material from
5 of the 6 stations involved was available for study and the lots from three of them contain specimens of G. oxycephala (st. 1006, PMBC 12544; st.
1008, PMBC 12543 and PMBC 13617; st. 1019, PMBC 12541). In contrast to G. tesselata, these animals have ailerons with interramal plates, conical proboscidial papillae with numerous transverse ridges, only one large, rounded post- chaetal lobe on the parapodia and, most signi- ficantly, a very elongate prostomium.
Distribution: In temperate zones and tropical seas;
intertidal to 2951 m. New record for Thailand.

Ailerons with pointed triangular base. First two parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes of about same length. Two shorter postchaetal lobes; notopodial lobe slender triangular, distinctly longer than rounded neuropodial lobe; in posterior parapodia neuro- podial lobe as long as notopodial lobe, both lobes slender triangular. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall
slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, about as long as notopodial postchaetal lobe; in posterior parapodia slender and elongated; in last parapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal lobe; situated termino- ventrally on parapodia. Branchiae non-retractile, simple, digitiform, from about parapodium 24 to near posterior end; situated medio-dorsally on parapodia; best developed in mid-body region, extending beyond prechaetal lobes.
Distribution: S China Sea, Vietnam, Andaman
Sea; 5–196 m. New record for the Indian Ocean.


Glycera sphyrabrancha Schmarda, 1861
Description: Body up to 194 mm long with up to
390 segments. Mid-body segments biannulate. Conical prostomium consisting of about 11–13 rings. Proboscis with two types of papillae: 1. numerous digitiform papillae without ridges; 2. isolated shorter and broader, oval to globular papillae without ridges. Ailerons with deeply incised base. First two parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Parapodia of mid-body with two slender triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes; neuropodial lobe usually slightly longer than notopodial lobe. One shorter, rounded postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri from 3rd parapodium, conical to oval, inserted on body wall slightly above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform; in anterior parapodia about as long as postchaetal lobe; in mid-body distinctly longer and wider; in posterior parapodia slender; in last arapodia about as long as neuropodial prechaetal lobe (Fig. 1C); situated termino-ventrally on parapodia. Branchiae non-retractile, simple; from about parapodium 14 to near posterior end, at first as a slight bulge, becoming digitiform from about parapodium 25–45; situated termino-dorsally on parapodia; best developed in mid-body region, extending far beyond prechaetal lobes.
Remarks: The above description is based on other specimens because only fragments are present in the BIOSHELF material. These fragments could be referred to G. sphyrabrancha on the basis of the unique morphology of the posterior parapodia.
Distribution: Mainly in tropical seas; intertidal to
250 m. New record for the Andaman Sea.
